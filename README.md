# **Tic Tac Toe ‚Äì Python Game with AI**



üé≤**Tic Tac Toe with AI** is a Python-based game that offers a creative twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe experience.  
Instead of the traditional Xs and Os, the game uses **colored squares**: the **blue square** represents the human player, while the **red square** represents the AI opponent.  



The game combines Python programming with a graphical interface using **Tkinter** and **Pillow**, making the gameplay both visually engaging and interactive.  

üöÄ **Requirements**

Before running the project, make sure you have:

 * Python 3.10+ installed (we tested with Python 3.13).
 * The following Python libraries installed:
 	- **tkinter** (comes by default with Python)
	- **pillow**


‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.Clone or download the project folder.

git clone https://github.com/NadiaZapodeanuNZ/Tic_Tac_Toe.git
cd Tic_Tac_Toe_Python


(If you don‚Äôt use GitHub, just download and extract the ZIP file instead.)
Install dependencies (only Pillow needs to be installed manually):

`python -m pip install pillow`

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Game

To start the game, run:

`python graphics.py`


A game window should appear where you can play Tic Tac Toe.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you get an error like ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL', install Pillow again with:

`python -m pip install pillow`
