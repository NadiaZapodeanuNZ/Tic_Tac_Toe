# **Tic Tac Toe â€“ Python Game with AI**



ðŸŽ²**Tic Tac Toe with AI** is a Python-based game that offers a creative twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe experience.  
Instead of the traditional Xs and Os, the game uses **colored squares**: the **blue square** represents the human player, while the **red square** represents the AI opponent.  



The game combines Python programming with a graphical interface using **Tkinter** and **Pillow**, making the gameplay both visually engaging and interactive.  

ðŸš€ **##Requirements**

Before running the project, make sure you have:

 * Python 3.10+ installed (we tested with Python 3.13).
 * The following Python libraries installed:
 	- **tkinter** (comes by default with Python)
	- **pillow**
